# VGDCN(Variational Graph convolution Deep Clustering Network)
A Deep Clustering Network based on VaDE and GCN

# Introduction
I improved the clustering accuracy by introducing GCN to VaDE. Dataset:USPS. The code will be updated later.

# Reference
 - This research is my undergraduate graduation project. Thanks for the support of my Alma Mater:Beijing Forestry University.
 - I may continue to study the deep clustering in Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences in my master's stage, which helped me a lot in this project. My new research will be published here in the name of Robot Vision Group.
